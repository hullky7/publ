0.  Pneumonoultramicroscopicsilicovolcanoconiosis is the longest word in a dictionary.
1.  getrusage is the function that returns time of implementations of check, load, size, and unload.
2.  There are 16 members in a variable of type struct rusage.
3.  We pass before and after by reference (instead of by value) to the function "calculate" because passing large structs by value is slow and takes up a lot of memory.
4.  The key aspect of the for loop is the c = fgetc(fp) function call. fgetc gets the next character (an unsigned char) from fp and advances the
    position indicator in fp until the end of the file (EOF) is reached. As each character is received, it is put through an if(if)-elseif-elseif
    logical sequence. Summarizing the sequence: 1) If the character is an alphabetical character or an apostrophe that is not at index 0 of the
    word, the character is appended to the word array. 2) Else if the character is numerical, the word is ignored and we skip ahead to the
    next word (which is found after a space). 3) Else if we hit a space or punctuation, we must have found a whole word so we terminate the word by
    adding \0 to the word array.
5.  fscanf with a format string like "%s" will read subsequent characters until a whitespace is found (whitespace characters are considered to be
    blank, newline and tab). Because words within the txt files sometimes end with punctuation, fscanf will view them as being part of the word,
    which complicates the reading procedure.
6.  The parameters for check (const char* word) and load (const char* dictionary) are declared as const pointers because we want
    to prevent changes to a read word and the dictionary we are using
